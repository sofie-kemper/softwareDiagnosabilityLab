PROGRESS:

week 1:
-Thomas: Trying to set up Defects4j on Windows (including setting up Perl and ant for windows) - Problems: git apply error during checkout, build errors for some of the projects during compile
-Thomas: Setting up gzoltar - NullPointerException during analysis
-Thomas: Reading some papers on fault localization/previous research
-Sofie: Setting up Defects4j
-Sofie: Trying to set up gzoltar (somehow doesn't work on Mac, NullpointerException)
-Sofie: Finding some books on Software Design/Code Metrics

week 2:
-Sofie: implementing script for computing suspiciousness scores (all available metrics)
-Sofie: automating the suspiciousness score generation + ranking + qualitative analysis (threshold)
-Sofie: adapting the bitbucket scripts so that they run on OSX -> we can now generate method-level coverage data
-Sofie: generating method-level coverage data for Lang-project
-Sofie/Thomas: read research on relation (organisational structure/code metrics)&(error proneness), analysis/ideas how this is applicable to our OSS projects
-Thomas: download & skim result data for Time bug 3 (statement level)
-Thomas: understand R-script to compute suspiciousness score provided by Sofie

week 3:
-Sofie: read papers on graph metrics
-Sofie: investigate at options and output format of JDCallgraph
-Sofie: select dynamic metrics to investigate and appropriate R packages
-Thomas: research about static metrics and tools to detect code smells
-Thomas: finally set up defects4j in Ubuntu VM
-Thomas: configure Teamscale and prepare Analysis profile, select appropriate code smells

week 4:
-Sofie: implement dynamic metrics as script
-Thomas: research on graph metrics, read paper about relation of graph metrics to factors like bugs severity, maintainability
-Thomas: implement python REST client to query static metrics from teamscale and transform them into an appropriate format

week 5:
-Thomas: refine python REST client - add calculation of density and propotion metrics
-Thomas: research on test suite metrics (especially DDU), gather ideas on bug metrics
-?? Sofie: implemetation of DDU

week 6:
-Thomas: research about ML techniques
-Thomas: Extract Teamscale metrics on buggy files as bug metrics
-?? Sofie: extract bug metrics from defects4j dissection
-?? Sofie: calculate dynamic metrics on buggy nodes
-?? Sofie: matching of faulty methods from defects4j to gzoltar

week 7:
-Thomas: setup of jdcallgraph and dot file generation
