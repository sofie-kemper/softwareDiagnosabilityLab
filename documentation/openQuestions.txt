### Open Questions/To Discuss

- threshold for classifying artifacts into suspicious/non-suspicious, possibilities:
  - no threshold, use regression on suspiciousness-score
  - no threshold, use regression on suspiciousness-rank
  - hard threshold, e.g., rank 10
  - compute threshold based on one project version
  - compute threshold based on project
  - compute 1 threshold for all our data
- using multi-edge dynamic graphs?
  - problem: we only have simplified graphs (provided by Mojdeh)
  - either generate them all (impractical) or leave out simplified metrics!
