\subsubsection{JDCallgraph}
\label{sec:jdcallgraph}

JDCallgraph is a tool for dynamic call graph generation for Java. Call graphs as
well as data dependency graphs can be computed and are provided in .dot format.
In addition, JDCallgraph can provide coverage and other information which we do
not use in this project. More details can be found via
\url{https://github.com/dkarv/jdcallgraph}.

The .dot-files are read into R (see \ref{sec:igraph}) via the R library sna (see
\url{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sna)}.

\subsection{R igraph Library}
\label{sec:igraph}

igraph is a library for network analysis. It is available for R, Python, and C
and allows fast and comfortable processing of large graphs. Many standard graph
metrics as well as an efficient graph data structure  are provided by this
library. More information can be found via \url{http://igraph.org/r/}.
