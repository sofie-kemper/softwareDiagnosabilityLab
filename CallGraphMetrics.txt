Tool: extended CodeViz - call graphs only for C/C++
	NodeRank	like PageRank but for Graphs, predicts bug ceverity
	Modularity Ratio(A) = Cohesion(A) / Coupling(A)		incurs high maintenance effort
	Average Degree = 2*|E| / |V|
	Clustering coefficient		prob. that two neibhours of node m are also connected
	Assortativity
	Graph diameter
