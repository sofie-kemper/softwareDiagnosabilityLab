Questions
    Should we use Math call graphs? Yes
    Especially should we use the versions with differing test cases?
        --> yes, in general only use callgraphs of the failing tests
        
Abgabe 21.06 - Improvements
	What did we imporve and why? What has changed in our mind?
        (sentences like "I've learned XY is not important and that's why I have to focus more on/ consider ZY" are also desired).
	If we didn't change anything, explain why

Vorschläge für Improvement Abgabe:
	Combination von static and dynamic (und weitere?) nehmen, da wir gelernt haben dass es nicht genügt nur eines von beiden separat zu betrachten
    - static metrics auf ganzes projekt bezogen eher unwichtig??
    - nicht die Menge an features sondern vielmehr die qualität dieser ist wichtig --> manuell features auswählen die vielversprechend sind und daraus Model generieren

Visualization
	Vizualization important in industry, but don't spend too much time on it for this Lab
	If we build different models: It's a good thing to visualize the models and compare them
    
Final result:
    Which set of features are the best?
    If we do ML and don't find good results
	We still can do correlation between feature and accuracy
		(--> to get overview what is useless/ could be important)
    She will compare our results/ models to see which one is the best
        best means which has the best accuracy (I think?) she will tell us which accuracy score we should calcualte for the model (probably F-score)
